        This project was our team's entry for the Philly Codefest 2025's
        Advanced category, and we also competed in the "For Social Good"
        category. We were only given 24 hours in total to work on and finish our
        project. Although we did not win, I am very proud of our efforts and our
        product.
        <br />
        <br />
        Our Resnet-18 model was trained with PyTorch and CUDA using 10,000
        images over 50 epochs to classify 7 different types of skin lesions.
        Using gradient descent and cosine annealing, we achieved an accuracy of
        around 88%. After training our model, we built a website using FastAPI
        to receive user images, and produce model images in real-time. Using
        OpenAI in combination with our model, we were also able to produce
        accurate diagnoses for patients and doctors. Above is the link to the
        GitHub page which also contains instructions for setting up and running
        the application, although it shouldn't work as it doesn't have a key to
        use OpenAI anymore. Below are images of our team, the pitch for our
        product, pictures from our finished website, and images for our model.

        Millions around the world lack access to dermatologists, leading to late
        diagnoses of serious skin conditions. Our AI-powered skin lesion
        detection app bridges this gap by providing instant, affordable, and
        accessible skin analysis. Simply upload a picture, and our technology
        predicts potential concerns—empowering early detection, especially in
        underserved communities. With this tool, we’re bringing life-saving
        dermatological insights to those who need them most.
        <br />
        Our model is trained on the HAM10000 dataset, which comprises data on
        seven different types of skin lesions, curated by medical professionals.
        We fine-tuned a PyTorch implementation of ResNet18 over 50 epochs,
        incorporating noise filtering during each training pass to overcome the
        challenges posed by the small dataset. These efforts have enabled us to
        achieve an accuracy rate of approximately 90% on our test evaluation.
