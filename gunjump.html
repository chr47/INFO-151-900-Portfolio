        Gun Jump was the first coding project that I ever worked on, and was
        built with a team of other freshman at my first year at Drexel. My main
        role was as a developer, working on the character movement and
        environment interaction. I also created music for the game, but I had 0
        experience in making any music so it isn't the best.
        <br />
        <br />
        Although this isn't a very good product in retrospect, given our
        experience and time frame I am still happy with how it turned out. I
        this in my project section as a reminder of where I started.
        <br />
        <br />
        The GitHub repository was unfortunately taken down by the school so I
        don't have access to any of the code, but I below is a demo that we
        included in our project submission.
