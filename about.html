          When I'm not programming or doing work for class, I enjoy playing
          video games with my friends, rock climbing, reading manga and
          webnovels, and listening to music. I am always very passionate about
          the activities that I enjoy.
          <br />
          <br />
          I started rock climbing in the summer before college, and have been
          on-and-off due to a couple of semi-serious injuries that I've gotten
          in my fingers. However, I have always stayed connected with the sport
          by working at Drexel's Rock Climbing Wall, and work both as a Manager
          while the rock wall is open for business, and as a "setter", which
          means that I create the routes that people climb. The main thing that
          I love about rock climbing is the problem solving, which is also why I
          love programming so much.
          <br />
          <br />
          I've been playing games almost my whole entire life, and have always
          been very competitive and passionate. My childhood dream was to become
          a pro gamer, and while that was never achieved, I am quite proud of my
          achievements. In high school, I achieved the rank of the Top 400
          players on Overwatch's North America East servers, and won a couple of
          tournaments with my high school's eSports team. While I don't play as
          seriously anymore and mainly use gaming as a way to spend time with
          friends, my passion and drive to succeed has carried over to
          programming.
