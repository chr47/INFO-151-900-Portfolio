        <p id="purpose statement">
          As a Computer Science major specializing in artificial intelligence
          and software engineering, I am driven by a passion for building
          intelligent, scalable systems that solve real-world problems. I enjoy
          solving problems, optimizing solutions, and creating practical
          software that can be used in a real-world context. Due to my work
          experience as a member of a team, I thrive in collaborative and
          commmunicative environments, where innovative thinking and continuous
          learning are valued.
        </p>
        <p id="philosphy statement">
          I believe that technology should empower people and solve meaningful
          challenges with clarity and integrity. Building intelligent software
          is not just about writing codeâ€”it requires empathy for users,
          collaboration across diverse teams, and a commitment to continuous
          improvement. By focusing on scalable, maintainable solutions and
          embracing innovation, I strive to contribute to projects that make a
          positive impact in both the tech community and the broader world.
