        This is a game that I worked on with my friend, Ryan Brosius, for the
        2023 Secret Santa Game Jam. For the Secret Santa Game Jam, teams are
        given prompts by another team, and must create a game based on this
        prompt to give to that team. Our prompt was for a space game, which is
        why our game has a space theme. We had around a month to work on this
        game jam, with a couple of weeks being during school and finals week.
        <br />
        <br />
        The game has 3 different bosses, each with different attack patterns and
        strategies. There is a score system that saves and displays the best
        achieved score. There is a demo of this game below, and you can also
        click the Itch.Io link above to play the game yourself.
